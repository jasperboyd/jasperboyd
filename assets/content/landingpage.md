##Windy Tunnel Media

Windy Tunnel Media is a DIY record label that I started working on in the spring of 2013. My goal with the project was to bring musicians together under one banner in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration. You can see the result [here](www.windytunnel.co). 

##The Weather Sound

The Weather Sound is a experiment in computer music. The premise was to create a program that made ambient music from real time weather data that didn't just sound like a smelly heap of garbage. The project is built in MAX / MSP. You can listen to it [here]().
