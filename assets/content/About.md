##About

I've been making music since I was very young and it has and will
always be one of the most important things in my life. For me 
music will always be the best medium for expression. 
				  
				
I feel that in the world of today, it's easy to get overwhelmed. 
There's so much information everywhere readily available. More 
than anything knowing how to harness that resource productively,
is the most important skill one can have. 
	
I've been teaching myself things from the internet for as long 
as I can remember. It's easily one of the greatest tools that 
people have built from themselves, and allows for all sorts 
of useful applications. 
	
It is out of this modern environment that my love of technology 
has grown.
